# **Coffee-Shop-Sales Data Analysis and Visualization Project**

## **Objective**
To perform a comprehensive analysis of sales data using SQL for data extraction and aggregation, and Power BI for creating intuitive visualizations. The analysis will highlight monthly sales trends, order patterns, quantities sold, and differences across specific periods and store locations.

## **Key Analysis Areas**

### 1. **Total Sales Analysis**
   - Calculate the **total sales** for each respective month.
   - Determine the **month-on-month (MoM) increase or decrease** in sales.
   - Calculate the **difference in sales** between the selected month and the previous month.

### 2. **Total Order Analysis**
   - Calculate the **total number of orders** for each respective month.
   - Determine the **month-on-month (MoM) increase or decrease** in the number of orders.
   - Calculate the **difference in the number of orders** between the selected month and the previous month.

### 3. **Total Quantity Sold Analysis**
   - Calculate the **total quantity sold** for each respective month.
   - Determine the **month-on-month (MoM) increase or decrease** in the total quantity sold.
   - Calculate the **difference in the total quantity sold** between the selected month and the previous month.

## **Visualization Requirements**

### 1. **Calendar Heat Map**
   - Implement a **dynamic calendar heat map** that adjusts based on the selected month from a slicer.
   - Use color-coding to indicate sales volume, with **darker shades representing higher sales**.
   - Include **tooltips** to show detailed metrics (Sales, Orders, Quantity) when hovering over specific days.

### 2. **Sales Analysis by Weekdays and Weekends**
   - Segment sales data into **weekdays and weekends** for performance comparison.
   - Analyze patterns to determine if there are significant differences between **weekday and weekend sales**.

### 3. **Sales Analysis by Store Location**
   - Visualize sales data across **different store locations**.
   - Provide **Month-on-Month (MoM) difference metrics** based on the selected month in the slicer.
   - Highlight MoM sales changes for each store location to identify emerging trends.

## **Tools Used**
- **SQL**: For extracting and aggregating data from the database.
- **Power BI**: For building interactive and dynamic dashboards that provide clear insights.

## **Goals**
- Deliver a comprehensive visualization of sales data trends over time.
- Enable dynamic filtering using slicers for detailed exploration.
- Visualize and compare sales performance by **day, week, and store location**.
- Highlight notable changes in sales volumes, orders, and quantities sold.
- Provide actionable insights for better decision-making.
